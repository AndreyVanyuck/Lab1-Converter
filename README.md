## 'Americans are asleep. Upvote the metric system!'
A 'Unit/Currency Converter' application.

1. Minumum 3 different unit categories (distance, weight, currency, etc)
2. At least 3 different units in each category.
3. Calculator-like num pad and two fields for original and converted values. The user should not be able to change data in these fields with default system keyboard.
4. A keyboard and data should be in separate android fragments.
   - portrait orientation: fragments are placed in a row (keyboard below data fragment)
   - landscape orientation: fragments have to be aligned in line.
5. Create a 'premium' build flavour.
   - There should be a button, that will switch initial and converted values (and units) and vice-versa.
   - A button to copy current value to the clipboard near each data field.
   - Use source sets to define different layouts and files with code for each flavour.
